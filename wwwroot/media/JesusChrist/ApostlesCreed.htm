<H1>The Apostles Creed</h1>
<h2>


    <br>

    <p>
        I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
    <p>
        the Creator of heaven and earth,
    <p>
        and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord;
    <p>
        Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
    <p>
        born of the Virgin Mary,
    <p>
        suffered under Pontius Pilate,
    <p>
        was crucified, died, and was buried.
    <p>

        He descended to the dead.
    <p>
        The third day he arose again from the dead.
    <p>
        He ascended into heaven
    <p>
        and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,
    <p>
        whence he shall come to judge the living and the dead.
    <p>
        I believe in the Holy Spirit,
    <p>
        the holy universal Church,
    <p>
        the communion of saints,
    <p>
        the forgiveness of sins,
    <p>
        the resurrection of the body,
    <p>
        and the life everlasting.
    <p>
        Amen.
    <p>
